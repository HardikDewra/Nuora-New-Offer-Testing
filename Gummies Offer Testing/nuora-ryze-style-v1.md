## Key Learnings

1. Removing the one-time purchase option almost eliminated OTP orders (21 -> 1)
2. Subscription orders remained similar (79 vs 81)
3. Lower conversion rate suggests the forced subscription may have deterred some buyers
4. Significantly reduced session duration indicates faster decision-making but not better conversion
5. Higher profit per visitor despite lower revenue suggests subscription-only may work for retention-focused strategy
