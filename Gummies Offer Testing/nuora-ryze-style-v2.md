## Key Learnings

1. **Adding product images did NOT improve conversion** - V2 performed nearly identical to V1
2. Subscription-only model continues to eliminate OTP completely (14 -> 0)
3. Despite achieving 100% subscription rate, overall orders dropped (64 -> 44)
4. Control continues to outperform significantly (97.75% probability to win)
5. Session duration still reduced (-26.1%) - users decide faster but don't convert better
6. CRITICAL INSIGHT: The problem is the subscription-only model, not the visual design
7. Product images are not the lever that drives conversion in this context
8. The Ryze-style offer fundamentally doesn't work for Nuora's audience regardless of visual enhancements
